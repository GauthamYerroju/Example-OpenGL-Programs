# Example OpenGL Graphics Programs
## This is for use at the University of Nevada, Reno CS 480/680 Graphics Class
Any students in that class follow the instructions at [**Github Setup**](https://github.com/HPC-Vis/computer-graphics/wiki/Github-Setup) to begin. This is part of the first assignment in the class and necessary for turning in assignments throughout the semester.

Read through the Wiki on this repository to understand how each class works. This Wiki focuses on the code in PA1.

# Projects

## PA0: Triangle
This is a simple colored triangle on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA0``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA1: Spinning Cube
This is a cube that rotates in place while orbiting around the origin on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA1``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA2: Interaction (Keyboard and Mouse)
This is a cube that rotates in place while orbiting around the origin on the screen. The cube rotation and orbit can be reversed using keybaord and mouse commands. The cube rotation and orbit can be toggled (start/stop) and the program can be paused or resumed using keyboard commands. To run this project ```cd PA2``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA3: Moons
This is a cube (planet) that rotates in place while orbiting around the origin on the screen. The cube rotation and orbit can be reversed using keybaord and mouse commands. The cube rotation and orbit can be toggled (start/stop) and the program can be paused or resumed using keyboard commands. Further, there is another cube (moon) which rotates around its own axis and orbits the first cube. The cube rotation and orbit can be reversed using keyboard commands. The cube rotation and orbit can be toggled (start/stop). To run this project ```cd PA3``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA4: Blending and Model Loading
This is an model loader which loads triangulated blender OBJ files. Verticies and faces are loaded and then rendered to rotate on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA4``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA5: Assimp and Model Loading
This is a group project consisting of the following three collaborators:

Kevin Green  
Husain Tazarvi  
Gautham Yerroju  

This is a model loader using assimp to load verticies, faces, and colors from a model and render the model to rotate on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA5``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA6: Assimp with Textures
This is a group project consisting of the following three collaborators:

Kevin Green  
Husain Tazarvi  
Gautham Yerroju  

This application loads a model and its associated texture(s). The model is then rendered to rotate on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA6``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA7: Assimp with Textures
This is a group project consisting of the following three collaborators:

Kevin Green
Husain Tazarvi
Gautham Yerroju

This application (roughly) simulates the Solar System, with controls for changing the camera and simulation speed. To run this project ```cd PA7``` then follow the in7tructions in the README.md.
